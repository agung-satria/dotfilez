Enigmas of the universe cannot be known without a search
We will find all roads that lead to Om
To know the wonder of the soul, we should go with the cosmic flow
Life's a labyrinth, find your way home

Rise with me
Transcend the shifting maze

Day and night, we hunt for answers hiding deep inside
Dark and light, these are the ends we can't unite
Black and white will free the way for us to see
That we are dancing in duality

Expose the corners of the mind, do scour edges of the sky
Don't fly higher than you dare to fall
The truth lies buried under dark, yet souls do rise from cosmic heart
A brush of red on white, celestial art

Rise with me (rise with me)
Before the end of days

Day and night, we hunt for answers hiding deep inside
Dark and light, these are the ends we can't unite
Black and white will free the way for us to see
That we are dancing in duality

An inner journey to be made, another ego is at stake
A revelation for the soul tonight

Rise with me (rise with me)
Before the light decays

Day and night, we hunt for answers hiding deep inside
Dark and light, these are the ends we can't unite
Black and white, reveal the path we can ascend
And spiral towards oneness in the end
