I love you
But I don′t really show you
I'd call you
But only if you want me too

Oh, don′t you let it stop
Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
I will never stop
But only if you listen to me

Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh

Come inside of my heart
If you′re looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh

Oh, baby
Forgive me if I hurt you
Come save me
′Cause you're the only one for me

Oh, don′t you let it stop
Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
I will never stop
But only if you listen to me

Come inside of my heart
If you′re looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh

Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh

Whatever happens to me, baby
I′m sorry
No one could ever go my way
I love you
But I don't really show you

Come inside of my heart
If you're looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Come inside of my heart, baby)

Come inside of my heart
If you′re looking for answers
Look at the stars
Go a little bit faster
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
