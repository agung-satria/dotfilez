Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from youBurning on
Just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what′s the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What′s the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What′s the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We′ll meet again
When both our cars collide

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
